## 🧐 About <a name = "about"></a>

The Conventional Commits specification is a lightweight convention on top of commit messages. It provides an easy set of rules for creating an explicit commit history; which makes it easier to write automated tools on top of. This convention dovetails with SemVer, by describing the features, fixes, and breaking changes made in commit messages.

## Installing <a name = "installing"></a>

## 🎈 Usage <a name="usage"></a>

<body>

<footer>
```
